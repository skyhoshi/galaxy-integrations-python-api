# GOG GALAXY Integrations Python API

This Python library allows developers to easily build community integrations for various gaming platforms with GOG GALAXY **2.1**.

- refer to our <a href='https://galaxy-integrations-python-api.readthedocs.io'>documentation</a>

Note: For integrations targeting GOG GALAXY the **below 2.1.0 version**, please refer to [this version](https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-api/tree/0.69).

## Features

Each integration in GOG GALAXY 2.1 comes as a separate Python script and is launched as a separate process that needs to communicate with the main instance of GOG GALAXY 2.1.

The provided features are:

- multistep authorization using a browser built into GOG GALAXY 2.1
- support for GOG GALAXY 2.1 features:
  - importing owned and detecting installed games
  - installing and launching games
  - importing achievements and game time
  - importing friends lists and statuses
  - importing friends recommendations list
  - receiving and sending chat messages
- cache storage

## Platform Id's

Each integration can implement only one platform. Each integration must declare which platform it's integrating.

[List of possible Platform IDs](PLATFORM_IDs.md)

## Basic usage

Each integration should inherit from the `galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin` class. Supported methods like `galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.get_owned_games` should be overwritten - they are called from the GOG GALAXY client at the appropriate times.
Each of those methods can raise exceptions inherited from the `galaxy.api.jsonrpc.ApplicationError`.
Communication between an integration and the client is also possible with the use of notifications, for example: `galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.update_local_game_status`.

The minimum implementation requires to override `galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.authenticate` and `galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.get_owned_games` methods.

```python
import sys
from galaxy.api.plugin import Plugin, create_and_run_plugin
from galaxy.api.consts import Platform
from galaxy.api.types import Authentication, Game, LicenseInfo, LicenseType


class PluginExample(Plugin):
    def __init__(self, reader, writer, token):
        super().__init__(
            Platform.Test,  # choose platform from available list
            "0.1",  # version
            reader,
            writer,
            token
        )

    # implement methods

    # required
    async def authenticate(self, stored_credentials=None):
        return Authentication('test_user_id', 'Test User Name')

    # required
    async def get_owned_games(self):
        return [
            Game('test', 'The Test', None, LicenseInfo(LicenseType.SinglePurchase))
        ]


def main():
    create_and_run_plugin(PluginExample, sys.argv)

# run plugin event loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Deployment

The client has a built-in Python 3.13 interpreter, so integrations are delivered as Python modules.
In order to be found by GOG GALAXY 2.1 an integration folder should be placed in [lookup directory](#deploy-location). Beside all the Python files, the integration folder must contain [manifest.json](#deploy-manifest) and all third-party dependencies. See an [exemplary structure](#deploy-structure-example).

### Lookup directory

<a name="deploy-location"></a>

- Windows:

    `%localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`

- macOS:

    `~/Library/Application Support/GOG.com/Galaxy/plugins/installed`

### Logging
<a href='https://docs.python.org/3.13/howto/logging.html'>Root logger</a> is already setup by GOG GALAXY to store rotated log files in:

- Windows:

    `%programdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs`

- macOS:

    `/Users/Shared/GOG.com/Galaxy/Logs`

Plugin logs are kept in `plugin-<platform>-<guid>.log`.
When debugging, inspecting the other side of communication in the `GalaxyClient.log` can be helpful as well.

### Manifest

<a name="deploy-manifest"></a>
Obligatory JSON file to be placed in an integration folder.

```json
{
    "name": "Example plugin",
    "platform": "test",
    "guid": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "version": "0.1",
    "description": "Example plugin",
    "author": "Name",
    "email": "author@email.com",
    "url": "https://github.com/user/galaxy-plugin-example",
    "script": "plugin.py"
}
```

| property      | description |
|---------------|---|
| `guid`        | custom Globally Unique Identifier |
| `version`     | the same string as `version` in `Plugin` constructor |
| `script`      | path of the entry point module, relative to the integration folder |

### Dependencies

All third-party packages (packages not included in the Python 3.13 standard library) should be deployed along with plugin files. Use the following command structure:

```pip install DEP --target DIR --implementation cp --python-version 313```

For example, a plugin that uses *requests* could have the following structure:

<a name="deploy-structure-example"></a>

```bash
installed
└── my_integration
    ├── galaxy
    │   └── api
    ├── requests
    │   └── ...
    ├── plugin.py
    └── manifest.json
```
